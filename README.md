_Reindexer is an embeddable, in-memory, document-oriented database with a high-level Query builder interface. Reindexer's goal is to provide fast search with complex queries. We at Restream weren't happy with Elasticsearch and created Reindexer as a more performant alternative. The core is written in C++ and the application level API is in Go._
